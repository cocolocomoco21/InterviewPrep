# Bubble Sort
## Overview

"Bubble" smaller items to the front by slowly swapping them incrementally on each pass of the sort.

## Typical Use-Case

Academic. This shouldn't be used in practice.

## More Details and Definitions

Bad, inefficient. Don't do.

#
## Algorithm
Start at beginning of array and swap first two elements if the first is greater than the second. Do this for the next pair, and the next pair. Do this sweep of n elements n times.

#
## Time Complexity
**Worst, best, average**: O(n^2)

Iterate over n elements n times to give O(n^2).

**Memory**: O(1)

Bubble sort is done in place.

## Space Complexity

#
## Distinguishing Features
- Normally somewhat meme-y with how bad it is.

#
## Strengths and Weaknesses

- Easy to understand?

**Weaknesses**:
- Very inefficient (O(n^2))
