# Object-Oriented Programming - Inheritance
## Overview

In object-oriented programming, inheritance enables a class to extend (inherit) from an existing class. This enables hierarchical relationships between classes. An inheriting class receives all data and methods from the inherited class, and is able to add their own additional data and methods to their own class.

For example, an Employee class might inherit from class Person. All data and methods available to Person apperars in Employee. addition to its own instance variables, like firstName and position.

## More Details and Definitions

Inheritance is used to represent a "is-a-type-of" relationship between objects. In the above example, Employees have an Address.

#
## Distinguishing Features
- Inheritance enables representation of real world relationships and code reuse by extending already-implemented base classes.

#
## Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths**:
- Allows for easy reuse of the same definitions
- Mirroring real-world relationships

**Weaknesses**:
- ? 

#
## Example uses
- Employee class inherits Person class
