# Object-Oriented Programming - Composition
## Overview

In object-oriented programming, composition is the idea that objects can contain other objects in their instance variables.

For example, an Employee class might contain an object of the Address class, in addition to its own instance variables, like firstName and position.

## More Details and Definitions

Object composition is used to represent a "has-a" relationship between objects. In the above example, Employees have an Address.

#
## Distinguishing Features
- Composition enables complex classes by allowing a class to use other classes/objects as instance variables.

#
## Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths**:
- Enables multiple "levels" of objects, which allows for realistic representations of problems

**Weaknesses**:
- ? 

#
## Example uses
- Employee class has Address class
