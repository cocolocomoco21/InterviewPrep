## Time Complexity Summary
### Arrays
- Access: O(1)
- Insertion (at specific): O(n)
- Append (at end): O(1) (amortized)
- Deletion: O(n)
- Search: O(n)

### Linked lists
- Access/Search/Lookup: O(n)
- Insert (at specific): O(n)
- Append/Prepend (at beginning/end): O(1)
- Deletion: O(n)

### Stacks
- Access (at a given location)/Search: O(n)
- Push: O(1) (possibly amortized)
- Pop: O(1)
- Peek(): O(1)

### Queues
- Access (at a given location): O(n)
- Enqueue/Add: O(1)
- Dequeue/Remove: O(1)
- Peek: O(1)
