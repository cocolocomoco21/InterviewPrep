# InterviewPrep
Welcome to my interview prep repo. This repo will (eventually - it's still in progress) contain everything I use for fundamental interview prep for technical software interviews.

## Table of Contents
(This ToC will be updated as I write out the repo.)

### Chapter 1: Data Structures
#### I: Arrays
#### II: Linked Lists
#### III: Stacks
#### IV: Queues

## Roadmap
Below is tentative plan for the repo and not really part of the README as it matters to you.


Interview Prep:

Chapter 1: Data Structures
    For each data structure, give the following:
        Overview/Description
            Time complexity
            Space complexity
    I: Arrays
    II: List
    III: Linked List
    IV: Set
    V: Stack
    VI: Queue
    VII: Heap
    VIII: Hash table
    IX: Trees
    X: Graphs

Chapter 2: Algorithms
    I: Sorting
        Bubble
        Insertion
        Selection
        Quick sort
        Merge sort
        Heap sort
        Radix sort
    II: Graph algorithms
        DFS
        BFS
        Topo
        Dijkstra's
        Bellman-Ford
        Prim's
        Kruskal's
        (other algos we talked about in 577)
    III: Dynamic Programming
    IV: Combinatorics
    V: P/NP
    VI: Greedy algorithms
    VII: AI algorithms

Chapter 3: Programming Languages and Methods
    Run through different languages and how they stack up in the following things:
        How it compiles/is interpreted
        How it runs
        Static vs. dynamic
        Strong vs. weakly typed
        Performance: strengths, weaknesses

Chapter 4: Nitty Gritty Computing
    Memory, CPU, storage, etc. and how it all works together
    Databases
    Networking
    Operating systems

Chapter 5: Software Engineering
    Processes: Agile, scrum, kanban
    Development:
        DevOps
        Test-driven development
    Tests:
        How to write proper unit tests
        What unit tests should cover
        Different types of tests: unit, integration, smoke, regression

Chapter 6: Cracking the Coding Interview
