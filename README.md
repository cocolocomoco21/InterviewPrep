# InterviewPrep
Welcome to my interview prep repo. This repo will (eventually - it's still in progress) contain everything I use for fundamental interview prep for technical software interviews.

This repo contains the general interview topics: data structures, algorithms, time complexity, etc. Further, it contains more tailored material, such as OOP and design, software engineering practices and processes, and more technical topics like databases, OS, networks, and AI. Lastly, it contains some solutions to Cracking the Coding Interview and Leetcode.

## Roadmap (in progress)
Below is tentative plan for the repo and not really part of the README as it matters to you. This is just a dump of potential topics and a rough outline of how they'd be organized.


Interview Prep:

```

    IV: Combinatorics
    V: P/NP
    VI: Greedy algorithms
    VII: AI algorithms

Chapter 3: Programming Languages and Methods
    Run through different languages and how they stack up in the following things:
        How it compiles/is interpreted
        How it runs
        Static vs. dynamic
        Strong vs. weakly typed
        Performance: strengths, weaknesses

Chapter 4: Nitty Gritty Computing
    Memory, CPU, storage, etc. and how it all works together
    Databases
    Networking
    Operating systems

Chapter 5: Software Engineering
    Processes: Agile, scrum, kanban
    Development:
        DevOps
        Test-driven development
    Tests:
        How to write proper unit tests
        What unit tests should cover
        Different types of tests: unit, integration, smoke, regression

Chapter 6: Cracking the Coding Interview

Lastly, if you made it this far, this is some ASCII art I made that I thought was cool and didn't have anywhere else to put.
